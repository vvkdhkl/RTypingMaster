Thesis Project: Data Analysis

Most of the analysis was done in R.
Some data manipulation/extraction was done using Python.

Database used: MySQL
Key R libraries: RMySQL, ff, data.table, ggplot2, SparkR, Cluster, reshape2, corrplot, (d)plyr, XML

Note: The scripts don't run directly, they need access to the database and the logfiles, which are not available here.
